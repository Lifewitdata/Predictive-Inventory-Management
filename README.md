# Predictive-Inventory-Management
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges in predicting sales accurately, leading to either stockouts or overstocking. Inefficient inventory management can result in:

Financial losses
Poor customer experience
Excessive holding costs

ðŸŽ® Objective
This project aims to develop a robust sales forecasting system to:

Analyze historical sales data for pattern identification
Build predictive models for future sales forecasting
Optimize inventory management through data-driven insights
Reduce costs and minimize stockouts

ðŸ”„ Project Workflow
1. Data Collection

Gather historical sales data
Validate data quality and completeness
Ensure consistent data format

2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values
Engineer relevant features
Perform necessary transformations
Normalize/standardize data

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize sales trends
Identify seasonal patterns
Analyze category-wise performance
Generate statistical insights

4. Time Series Forecasting

Implement multiple forecasting models:

ARIMA
Exponential Smoothing
Advanced ML models


Fine-tune model parameters

5. Model Evaluation

Calculate RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
Measure MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
Compare model performances
Validate predictions

6. Inventory Optimization

Calculate optimal reorder points
Determine safety stock levels
Minimize holding costs
Prevent stockouts

7. Reporting

Generate automated reports
Create interactive visualizations
Provide actionable insights
